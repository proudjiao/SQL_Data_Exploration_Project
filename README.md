## Why SQL?
Knowing that my past internship experience as a Talent Acquisition Intern at McCANN WorldGroup and salesperson at MHP law firm does not help me get into a tech company with my current Computational Math and Statistics double major, I eagerly waited for the englightment of the Director of International Program, which might give me the slightest hint of where I should be heading next with what I currently have.

"Having graduated six years and now working as a senior data analysist for Amazon, I am now revealing the absolute truth of college." The director of the international program paused annoyingly and took a sip of his coffee, "College doesn't teach a shit that you need in industries. If you want industrial knowledge, stop taking maximum units of classes every quarter. Get you ass moving on projects!!!"

"But what projects?"

"Par exemple, learn some SQL. They never teach you in college. But it's the industry standard. You need to know SQL if you want to do any data-reated stuff!"

"Okay, but where do I learn it?"

"Voila." He said, handing me the precious website links on that I now am presenting to you on the top of this README.md document.
